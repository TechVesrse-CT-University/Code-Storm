# Code-Storm       Team number:64


We have made a Healthcare system which will give the disease name according to the symptoms the user will give, and it will provide the nearest hospital with nearest path on the basis of the symptoms the user has given.
It will allow you to track your health record, and we have covered the major parameter of healthy life which are Body mass index, Blood pressure, Blood sugar level.
It will tell you the NEAREST HOSPITAL WITH ALL THE LIST OF DOCTORS AVAILABLE AT THE HOSPITAL.
One can add the reminders of their upcoming tests, medicine schedules, all physical tests.
This website is basically focuses on RURAL AND SUB URBAN AREAS.
